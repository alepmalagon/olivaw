# Olivaw

Machine learn all the way to psychohistory.

## Overview

Olivaw is a project inspired by Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, where psychohistory is a fictional science that combines history, sociology, and mathematical statistics to make general predictions about the future behavior of very large groups of people.

This repository aims to explore machine learning techniques and models that could potentially contribute to predictive analytics of complex social systems.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Core functionality of the project
- `examples/`: Example use cases and demonstrations
  - `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with tutorials and examples
    - `get-started/`: Getting started notebooks including Apache Beam examples

## Getting Started

To get started with Olivaw:

1. Clone this repository

   git clone https://github.com/alepmalagon/olivaw.git
   cd olivaw
   ```

2. Set up your environment (recommended to use a virtual environment)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # Once requirements are defined
   ```

3. Explore the example notebooks in the `examples/notebooks/` directory
