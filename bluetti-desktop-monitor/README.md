- üîó **Device Connection**: Connect to and manage multiple Bluetti power stations
- üìä **Real-time Monitoring**: View battery level, power input/output, and charging status
- üíª **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- üé® **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface with real-time updates

## Screenshots

*Screenshots will be added once the app is running*

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16 or higher
- Bluetooth adapter (built-in or USB)
- Bluetti power station with Bluetooth capability

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd bluetti-desktop-monitor
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run in development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Building for Production

Build for your current platform:
```bash
npm run build
```

Build for specific platforms:
```bash
npm run build-win    # Windows
npm run build-mac    # macOS
npm run build-linux  # Linux
```

## Usage

1. **Launch the Application**: Start the app and ensure Bluetooth is enabled on your computer

2. **Scan for Devices**: Click "Scan Devices" to search for nearby Bluetti power stations

3. **Connect to Device**: Click "Connect" on any discovered device to establish a connection

4. **Monitor Your Device**: View real-time data including:
   - Battery percentage and visual indicator
   - Power input (charging watts)
   - Power output (load watts)
   - Current charging status
   - Device information

5. **Manage Connection**: Use the refresh button to update data manually or disconnect when done

## Supported Devices

This application should work with most Bluetti power stations that support Bluetooth connectivity, including:

- AC series (AC200P, AC300, AC500, etc.)
- EB series (EB150, EB240, etc.)
- EP series (EP500, EP600, etc.)
- B series (B230, B300, etc.)

*Note: Some older models may have limited Bluetooth functionality*

## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Main Process**: Handles Bluetooth communication and device management
- **Renderer Process**: Manages the user interface and user interactions
- **IPC Communication**: Secure communication between processes using Electron's IPC

### Bluetooth Protocol

The app uses MODBUS-over-Bluetooth protocol to communicate with Bluetti devices, based on the reverse-engineered protocol from the [bluetti_mqtt](https://github.com/warhammerkid/bluetti_mqtt) project.

### Dependencies

- **Electron**: Desktop app framework
- **@abandonware/noble**: Bluetooth Low Energy library for Node.js
- **modbus-serial**: MODBUS protocol implementation

### Adding New Features

1. **Bluetooth Features**: Modify files in `src/bluetooth/`
2. **UI Features**: Update `src/renderer/` files
3. **Main Process**: Edit `src/main.js` for app-level functionality

### Debugging

- Run with `npm run dev` to enable developer tools
- Check logs in the `logs/` directory
- Use Electron DevTools for renderer process debugging

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Bluetooth not working:**
- Ensure Bluetooth is enabled on your system
- On Linux, you may need to run with sudo or configure permissions
- Check that your Bluetooth adapter supports BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)

**Device not found:**
- Make sure your Bluetti device is in pairing mode
- Ensure the device is within Bluetooth range (typically 10 meters)
- Try restarting both the app and your Bluetti device

**Connection fails:**
- Check if another app is already connected to the device
- Restart the Bluetooth service on your computer
- Try moving closer to the device

### Platform-specific Notes

**Windows:**
- May require Visual Studio Build Tools for native modules
- Windows 10 version 1803 or later recommended for best Bluetooth support

**macOS:**
- Requires macOS 10.15 or later
- May need to grant Bluetooth permissions in System Preferences

**Linux:**
- Requires BlueZ 5.0 or later
- May need to install additional packages: `sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez libbluetooth-dev libudev-dev`
